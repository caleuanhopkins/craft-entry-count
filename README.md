#Entry Count Plugin
The Entry Count Plugin was built specifically for training purposes and is used in the [Craft Plugin Development video 
course](https://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/craft-plugin-development/). It allows you to count and display the number of times that an entry has been viewed.
